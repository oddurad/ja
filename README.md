# Já

A sample app using [Já](http://www.ja.is)'s API to retrieve and view search results.

## How to run

Clone this repository, then (in the repository directory):
```
npm install
ng serve
```
Point your browser to http://localhost:4200 and you're good to go!

**Note:** For the API queries to work, you will need your own Já API key.
If you have one, insert it in place of `<YOUR_API_KEY>` in `search.service.ts`.
For more information see [here](http://gagnatorg.ja.is).
